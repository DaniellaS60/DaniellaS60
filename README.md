## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on a marketing tool that I want to use in my advertising firm. I am using it on businesses based in Africa. I am looking for help with setting it up in a way that allows me to constantly edit it and make changes depending on the industry it is being applied to. To start off with, I want the app to do market research.
